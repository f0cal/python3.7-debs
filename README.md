# Python 3.7 .debs
Scripts for building `python3.7` .debs for Debian systems that may not have them available. Also known as a "backport." This recipe is a lightly-modified version of someone else's [very nice work](https://github.com/chriskuehl/python3.6-debian-stretch) with `python3.6`.

## Why?
Because f-strings are nice. ...Oh, and Debian took `python3.6` out of the [pool](http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/) for some reason.

## How
From source. Just run the build script. It's not that hard. You can do it.
